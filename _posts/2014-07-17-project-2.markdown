description: The Grace Childrenâ€™s Foundation is working on connecting children in need of medical aid with doctors who are willing to provide pro bono services. Our team is working with Microsoft Employees to build an online tool to connect aid workers helping these children with available doctors. The tool also provides information on foundations and funds willing to finance this medical aid.
