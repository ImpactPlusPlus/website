description: Microsoft Philanthropies connects our teams with projects and experienced Microsoft employees who help provide guidance. We were invited to the 2018 annual Microsoft Hackathon to work on our projects and with their support we hope to tackle many more important issues. Their encouragement is what inspired us to host our own hackathon.
